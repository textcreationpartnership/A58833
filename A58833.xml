            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Scotish Inquisition; OR, A Short Account of the Proceedings OF THE Scotish Privy-Counsel, Justiciary Court, and those Commissionated by them, whereby the Consciences of good Men have been Tortured, the Peace of the Nation these several Years past exceedingly Disturbed, and Multitudes of Innocent People cruelly Oppressed, and inhumanely Murdered.</head>
            <p>IN the Tract of these years, altho' Informing was a Trade more encouraged than in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> yet they Arraigned mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes without Informer or Accuser; and whoever appeared not upon their Summar Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (which oftentimes was impossible) were treated as Criminals.</p>
            <p>They seized many of all Ranks, and detained then months, and years, without any significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cause of their Imprisonment; and seldom Liberate any such without Exorbitant Bail: but if they could find the least shadow to prosecute any suspected to mislike their Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courses, they precipitated their Process, not allowing them time or means to vindicate their Innocency.</p>
            <p>They sent their Inquisitors through their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Citizens houses, to examine whom they pleased, upon most intricate Questions of Church and State-government, and made their refusing to answer, or dissatisfactory answers, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Indictments; others seized in the Crowd at Executions, and some when visiting the imprisoned, were Condemned and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for refusing to justifie their Severities against their Brethren, and disowning their <hi>Dagon</hi> of Non-resistance.</p>
            <p>They frequently sent out Spies to Prisons, Cities and Country, under disguise, who by simulating their dissatisfaction at the Exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Government, and Zeal for persecuted P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ety, might draw words from the most wary, sustaining such and other Informers as habil Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to the taking away the Lives of many Innocents, notwithstanding of one Express Act of Parliament to the contrary.</p>
            <p>They often prosecuted without a Libel; and when they formed Libels, they seldom restricted themselves to the points therein contained, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as confessed who refused to answer their captions and Extranious Questions.</p>
            <p>They not only employed Emissaries, but Judges themselves were active to suborn Witnesses against the Lives, Estates and Honours of Peers and worthy Patriots (a palpably gross manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such an Intrigue, having qualified a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for a chief Seat in their High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) and when they could not find such Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Ruffians to serve their turns, they forced Pannals to answer <hi>de super Inquirendis,</hi> in the most Criminal cases. They have often sustained Jurors and Witnesses, who could not purge themselves of prejudice or partial Counsel.</p>
            <p>They have Indicted, Tryed, Condemned and Executed persons in one day; and when Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession hath been made for some time to prepare for Death, it hath been answered, They shall have no time to prepare for Heaven, Hell is too good for them. They have kept some in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Reprieves and Pordons, till the very day and hour of their Execution; others they have hanged early in the morning, thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the peoples seeing their Cruelty, and hearing, the dying persons last words, and too palpably designing by such surprizals the Ruine of their Souls. They frequently beat Drums about the Scaffolds, their Cause being such as could not bear the words of dying Christians. They searched several, when removing them from the Prison to the Scaffold, seized their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, that so they might not come to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>They would have their Laws to reach Thoughts as well as Actions, and many against whom they could charge no matter of fact, they sought to reach their Lives for their Thoughts, asking them, What think you of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Some they have wheedled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, by promising to favour their Ingenuity, upbraiding them for dissemblers if they would not speak freely, and by mock-expostulations; <hi>viz.</hi> Are ye ashamed of your Principles? Are ye afraid to give a Testimony, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> and forced them to subscribe their Confessions before the Council, which they produced as Witness against them at the Criminal Court, whereupon they were Sentenced and Executed.</p>
            <p>When any refused to give Categorical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, then could they extort all by Torture,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97916:2"/>with their Engines of Cruelty, the Boots, fired Matches betwixt the Fingers, and Thumbkins, and after torturing hanged several, tho' thereby they could extort nothing.</p>
            <p>When some had answered all their Questions, and cleared themselves of all charged against them, yet would they not pass them so, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some of their wicked Oaths, which they concluded they would not take, and according to the measure of tenderness they discovered in any, they apportioned the Oaths; to the stricter the more smooth; to the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xer the more harsh; such as once their own natural Consciences did scar at.</p>
            <p>They required not only to have their Laws obeyed, but subscribed also, holding it not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that people transgress them not, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise own the justice of them, and the lawfulness of the Authority Enacting them, and swear to maintain them, and yet when some have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to all they sought, yet would they not discharge them, but upon Bond to answer again when called.</p>
            <p>Not only Extrajudicial Confession will su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain with them, but when they have given the publick Faith, the King's Security, the Act and Oath of Council, that such Confessions should not militate, yet they have brought it in as Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and given it upon Oath, when their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Act and Oath was produced in open Court in demonstration of their Perjury.</p>
            <p>They used frequently to pack Juries, picking out such as they thought any thing tender, and not bloody enough, and sometimes Listed some who they concluded would not concur, that thereupon they might get occasion to exact their Fines.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when the Jury hath brought in their Verdict in favour of the Pannal, they have made them return and resume the Cognition of the Process again, and threatened them with an Assize of Error if they did not bring him in Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea frequently the Advocate threatened them under most peremptory Certifications if they found not the Impannalled Guilty; so that their using Juries was but for the Fashion.</p>
            <p>They have Sentenced innocent Persons twice, once to have their Ears cut off and Banished, and after the lopping off their Ears, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined them, and Sentenced them to death.</p>
            <p>They used to stage several together, of whom they knew some would comply, to tantalize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with the sight of their Liberty, thereby tempting them to bite more eagerly at their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They have not only Murdered many innocent Christians in taking their Lives, but also endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Murder their Reputation and the Cause they owned, loading it with most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Epithets, which was their peculiar policy, to bring the Heads of Suffering to points most obnoxious to common Censer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Some they Arraigned whom they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reach by adducing many Witnesses against in Tryal, nor by their Examination with their cruel Torture of the Boots, yet hath had their whole Estate seized, and also been sent to Prison in a Rock within the Sea, without being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of any Crime.</p>
            <p>They finding their means and motions under colour of Law, and Trals were too slow and troublesom to acquire y their designed Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that the publick Executions tended more to confirm and multiply the Lovers of Religion and Liberty, than to diminish and deter, took a more compendious way of sending out their Soulders impowered to Challenge and Examine whom they pleased, and to tender Oaths required by no Law, and to punish such by present death who refused to Swear, or scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to Answer their ensnaring Questions, which bloody Commissions were so faithfully Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that within few Weeks above Fifty inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Persons were cruelly Murdered in cold Blood, without either Tryal or Conviction, or respect to Age or Sex.</p>
